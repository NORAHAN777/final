# Individual Task for Songhong Han
 
## Instructions on how to interact with the work
I chose perlin noice to animate, so the picture is a continuous, circular, smooth and fluid animation. 
It doesn't need any interaction to trigger, just click on the page and it starts running.

## Individual approach to animating the group code
I chose "perlin noice". 
Since our picture is a landscape, I decided to use perlin noice to drive the two parts of the building, the water reflection and the water ripple. Both of these parts move slowly and smoothly in a circular motion, which I want to achieve the effect of water surface fluctuation.

## References
My inspiration comes from perlin noice described in week 10 tut, 
but the style of the picture was completed after my own thinking, and I did not find similar references on the Internet for support.
